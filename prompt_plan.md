Detailed Blueprint
1. Project Setup and Architecture
Monorepo Structure:

Create a repository with two main directories: one for the backend (Node.js server) and one for the frontend (Next.js app).
Configure a common CI/CD pipeline and testing framework (e.g., Jest for Node.js, React Testing Library for Next.js).
Version Control & Initial Commit:

Initialize a Git repository, set up a README, and commit the basic folder structure.
Technology Stack:

Backend: Node.js (Express)
Frontend: Next.js
LLM Integration: Use an LLM API (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude) combined with LangChain for prompt chaining
Integrations: GitHub (initially), with plans for GitLab and Bitbucket
Authentication: GitHub OAuth/Apps for secure integration
Testing: TDD with Jest and integration tests
2. Backend Development
API Endpoints:

Create basic endpoints such as a health check and a placeholder for processing PR analysis requests.
Webhook & Integration Endpoints:

Implement endpoints to receive webhook events from GitHub (PR creation, update, review request).
LLM Integration Module:

Develop a service module that communicates with the LLM API using LangChain for chaining prompts.
Code Analysis Module:

Build a module that processes the PR payload. This includes:
Extracting changed code
Running static analysis for security, performance, style, maintainability, and architectural issues
Prioritizing issues (Critical, Warning, Suggestion)
Feedback Generation Module:

Convert the raw analysis into human-readable inline comments and a summary report with links to affected lines.
Testing:

Write unit tests for each module using TDD principles.
3. Integration with Code Platforms
GitHub Integration (Initial Focus):
Implement a GitHub App or Action that triggers the backend‚Äôs analysis upon PR events.
Use OAuth/Personal Access Tokens for authentication.
Future Integrations:
Plan similar integration points for GitLab and Bitbucket (via CI/CD pipelines or webhooks).
4. Frontend Development
Dashboard & Configuration UI (Next.js):
Build a web interface for monitoring reviews, configuring integrations, and triggering manual reviews.
Ensure that the UI shows detailed feedback from the AI analysis.
Authentication and Settings:
Integrate with OAuth for GitHub and allow users to configure their tokens and integration settings.
5. End-to-End Testing and Deployment
Integration Tests:
Simulate PR events, verify API processing, and check that inline comments and summary reports are generated correctly.
Deployment:
Set up a deployment pipeline (e.g., using Vercel for Next.js and Heroku/another provider for the Node.js backend).
Integrate logging, error monitoring, and performance tracking.
6. Documentation
Developer Documentation:
Write clear guides on setting up the project, configuring integrations, and running tests.
Document each API endpoint, integration process, and how to extend the system.
Iterative Prompt Breakdown
Below is a series of prompts (each in its own markdown code block) that you can use with a code-generation LLM to implement the project step by step. Each prompt builds on the previous one, ensuring that no code is left orphaned and that testing is embedded at every stage.

Prompt 1: Project Setup & Initial Structure

# Prompt 1: Project Setup & Initial Structure

You are to create the initial project scaffold for an AI-Powered Code Review Assistant. The project should be structured as a monorepo with two directories:
- `/backend` for the Node.js API server.
- `/frontend` for the Next.js application.

Tasks:
1. Initialize a Git repository.
2. Create the folder structure with `/backend` and `/frontend`.
3. Add a README.md with a brief description of the project.
4. Create placeholder configuration files for Node.js (package.json) and Next.js.

Please generate the necessary files and content for the initial commit, ensuring that the structure is clean and modular.
Prompt 2: Basic Backend API Server
text
Copy
Edit
# Prompt 2: Basic Backend API Server

Develop a basic Node.js server using Express in the `/backend` directory. The server should:
1. Listen on a configurable port.
2. Provide a simple health-check endpoint at `/api/health` that returns a JSON object { "status": "ok" }.
3. Include unit tests (using Jest) for the health-check endpoint.

Ensure that the server is set up with proper error handling and that tests pass.
Prompt 3: LLM Integration Module with LangChain
text
Copy
Edit
# Prompt 3: LLM Integration Module with LangChain

In the `/backend` directory, create a module named `llmService.js` that will handle communication with the LLM API. Use LangChain for prompt chaining. The module should:
1. Provide a function to send a prompt to the LLM API and receive a response.
2. Allow chaining multiple prompts (if needed) for more complex analysis.
3. Include basic error handling and logging.
4. Be accompanied by unit tests verifying that the function properly constructs prompts and handles responses (mock the LLM API).

Focus on clear separation of concerns so that this module can be easily extended later.
Prompt 4: Code Analysis Module
text
Copy
Edit
# Prompt 4: Code Analysis Module

Develop a module in the `/backend` directory called `codeAnalyzer.js` that processes pull request payloads. The module should:
1. Accept a PR payload (simulate with JSON for now).
2. Extract changed files and code snippets.
3. Analyze the code for the following categories:
   - Security Vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks, insecure API calls, hardcoded secrets, outdated dependencies)
   - Performance Issues (e.g., inefficient loops, N+1 queries, excessive memory usage)
   - Code Style & Best Practices (e.g., naming inconsistencies, code duplication)
   - Maintainability (e.g., deeply nested conditionals, long functions)
   - Architectural Issues (e.g., violations of layered architecture)
4. Return a structured list of issues with metadata such as issue type, severity (Critical, Warning, Suggestion), and code location.

Include unit tests that simulate different PR payloads and verify that issues are detected and categorized correctly.
Prompt 5: Feedback Generation Module
text
Copy
Edit
# Prompt 5: Feedback Generation Module

In the `/backend` directory, create a module called `feedbackGenerator.js` that:
1. Takes the output from the `codeAnalyzer.js` module.
2. Converts the raw analysis data into human-readable feedback, including inline comment suggestions and a summary report.
3. Categorizes each issue with a severity level (Critical üö®, Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è, Suggestion üí°) and includes an explanation for why the issue matters.
4. Provides links or references to affected lines (simulate with line numbers for now).

Write unit tests to verify that the feedback is generated correctly and is coherent.
Prompt 6: GitHub Integration & Webhook Endpoint
text
Copy
Edit
# Prompt 6: GitHub Integration & Webhook Endpoint

Extend the backend server to integrate with GitHub:
1. Implement a webhook endpoint (e.g., `/api/webhooks/github`) that listens for PR events (creation, update, review request).
2. Parse the incoming payload to extract necessary information (changed files, commit details).
3. Trigger the code analysis (using `codeAnalyzer.js`) and feedback generation (using `feedbackGenerator.js`).
4. Return a response that includes the analysis summary.

Also, write tests for the webhook endpoint to simulate GitHub PR events and verify that the proper processing occurs.
Prompt 7: Frontend UI for Monitoring & Configuration

Edit
# Prompt 7: Frontend UI for Monitoring & Configuration

In the `/frontend` directory, develop a Next.js application that:
1. Provides a dashboard to display the status of code reviews.
2. Has a page for viewing detailed summary reports from the backend.
3. Includes a configuration page where users can set up their GitHub integration (e.g., entering OAuth details or tokens).
4. Uses API routes to communicate with the backend and display real-time data.
5. Includes basic unit and integration tests for the main components.

Wire the UI components so that they can display a list of review feedback and allow manual triggering of analysis.
Prompt 8: Implement Authentication & Permissions

# Prompt 8: Implement Authentication & Permissions

Enhance the backend to handle secure interactions:
1. Implement GitHub OAuth or GitHub App integration to authenticate requests.
2. Ensure that the webhook endpoints and API routes are protected and verify the authenticity of incoming requests.
3. Create middleware in the Node.js server for token validation.
4. Provide configuration endpoints (secured) for setting up and managing integration credentials.
5. Write tests to simulate authentication flows and ensure that unauthorized access is blocked.

Wire this authentication module into the existing backend API endpoints.
Prompt 9: End-to-End Integration Testing
text
Copy
Edit
# Prompt 9: End-to-End Integration Testing

Develop integration tests that simulate the entire flow from receiving a PR event to posting feedback:
1. Simulate a PR payload and trigger the webhook endpoint.
2. Verify that the LLM module, code analyzer, and feedback generator modules are invoked.
3. Confirm that the final output (inline comments and summary report) is structured correctly.
4. Ensure that the frontend dashboard (simulate API calls) can retrieve and display the analysis results.

Write comprehensive tests that cover all major interactions.
Prompt 10: Deployment Pipeline & Documentation

Copy
Edit
# Prompt 10: Deployment Pipeline & Documentation

Finalize the project by setting up the deployment pipeline and documentation:
1. Configure deployment scripts for both the `/backend` (e.g., Dockerfile, Heroku/other cloud deployment) and `/frontend` (e.g., Vercel configuration).
2. Integrate CI/CD to run tests on every commit.
3. Create detailed documentation covering:
   - Project setup and local development instructions.
   - API documentation for each endpoint.
   - Integration steps for GitHub (and later GitLab/Bitbucket).
   - How to run tests and deploy the project.
4. Ensure that the documentation includes a clear guide on how the modular prompts have been integrated.

The documentation should be clear and comprehensive to help other developers onboard quickly.
By following these prompts sequentially, you will build your project incrementally while ensuring that each component is fully integrated and tested. This approach emphasizes best practices, incremental progress, and strong testing from early on, with no orphaned code or big leaps in complexity.
