# Modular Prompts Architecture

This document explains the modular prompts approach used to build the AI Code Review Assistant.

## Overview

The project was developed using a modular prompt-based approach, where each component of the system was designed through a series of incremental prompts to an AI code assistant. This approach allowed us to:

1. Build the system incrementally
2. Ensure each component integrates well with others
3. Maintain high code quality and test coverage
4. Create a fully functional end-to-end solution

## Prompt Sequence

The system was built through the following sequence of prompts:

### Prompt 1: Project Setup & Initial Structure

Established the foundational structure of the project as a monorepo with:
- `/backend` directory for the Node.js Express API
- `/frontend` directory for the Next.js application
- Basic configuration files, README, and Git setup

### Prompt 2: Basic Backend API Server

Created a minimal Express server with:
- Health check endpoint
- Error handling middleware
- Logging setup
- Basic unit tests

### Prompt 3: LLM Integration Module with LangChain

Developed the LLM service to:
- Send prompts to an AI model
- Chain multiple prompts together
- Handle errors and retries
- Support custom prompt templates

### Prompt 4: Code Analysis Module

Created the core code analysis functionality to:
- Parse PR payloads and extract code changes
- Analyze code for security, performance, style, and architecture issues
- Categorize and prioritize issues
- Generate structured analysis output

### Prompt 5: Feedback Generation Module

Built the feedback generator to:
- Convert raw analysis into human-readable feedback
- Generate inline comments with context
- Create summary reports with statistics and recommendations
- Format feedback for GitHub comments

### Prompt 6: GitHub Integration & Webhook Endpoint

Implemented GitHub integration with:
- Webhook endpoint for PR events
- Authentication for GitHub API
- Signature validation for webhooks
- Repository access management

### Prompt 7: Frontend UI for Monitoring & Configuration

Developed the Next.js frontend with:
- Dashboard for viewing reviews
- Configuration interface for GitHub integration
- Detailed review reports
- User settings management

### Prompt 8: Authentication & Permissions

Added secure authentication with:
- GitHub OAuth integration
- JWT token management
- Protected API routes
- Permission checking

### Prompt 9: End-to-End Integration Testing

Created comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Test fixtures and mocks

### Prompt 10: Deployment Pipeline & Documentation

Finalized the project with:
- Deployment scripts for Heroku and Vercel
- CI/CD configuration with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready configuration

## Benefits of the Modular Approach

### 1. Incremental Development

Each prompt built upon the previous ones, allowing us to:
- Start with a minimal viable implementation
- Expand functionality in logical steps
- Test and refine each component before moving on

### 2. Well-Structured Architecture

The modular approach resulted in:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-defined interfaces between components
- Maintainable and extensible codebase

### 3. Comprehensive Testing

By integrating testing from the beginning:
- Every component has unit tests
- Integration testing verifies component interaction
- End-to-end tests ensure complete functionality

### 4. Documentation as a First-Class Citizen

Documentation was built alongside the code:
- API documentation
- Setup and deployment guides
- Integration instructions
- Clear comments in the code

## How Components Fit Together

The final architecture consists of interconnected components:

1. **GitHub Integration** receives webhook events when PRs are created or updated
2. **Code Analysis Module** processes the code changes
3. **LLM Integration** enhances the analysis with AI-powered insights
4. **Feedback Generator** creates human-readable feedback
5. **API Endpoints** provide interfaces for the frontend and external services
6. **Frontend UI** allows users to view and configure the system

## Extending the System

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend the system:

### Adding New Integrations

To add support for a new code platform (e.g., GitLab):
1. Create a new webhook endpoint
2. Implement platform-specific API client
3. Add OAuth integration for the platform
4. Update the frontend to configure the new platform

### Enhancing Analysis Capabilities

To improve code analysis:
1. Add new analysis categories
2. Implement additional issue detection algorithms
3. Extend the feedback templates
4. Update tests to cover new capabilities

### Scaling the System

To handle larger repositories or more frequent reviews:
1. Add database persistence
2. Implement a queue for processing PRs
3. Add caching for frequently accessed data
4. Set up horizontal scaling

## Conclusion

The modular prompts approach enabled us to build a complex system incrementally while maintaining high quality and ensuring that all components work together seamlessly. This architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and integrations.
